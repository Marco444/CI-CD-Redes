# CI/CD

This is a project that seeks to provide a continuos integration and deployment solution for a full-stack web application, as well as a AWS architecture defined in terraform


## LendARead's Goal

The goal of the web application is to create a community of readers, where all of them can upload their books and request loans from each other. The aim is to allow readers to access books that would not normally be easily accessible.

For example, let's imagine the user Marco, who enjoys reading philosophy in multiple languages. Thanks to other readers with German heritage (for example), he can borrow a philosophy book from a German author that he could not have read by going to a library in Argentina.


## Terraform

The LendARead architecture is deployed through terraform as part of a 3-tier architecture. This is a simplified version as it does not hold the SPA in a S3 bucket, but it clearly exemplifies a correct separation of concerns

## CI/CD Requirements

Create a pipeline that includes the following elements:

- Have a code repository in Git that, every time a push occurs, builds the code and deploys it in a container (on-premise with Docker, deploying it in Kubernetes on-premise or using EKS or ECS on AWS), on a virtual machine, or in a serverless execution service (for example, Lambda).
- Prior to deployment, execute the unit tests of the code.
- Send a notification to the DevOps team if the deployment was successful. If it was unsuccessful, send a notification, stop the deployment, and perform a rollback.
- Before deployment in the environment, create a manual approval process for a select group of people.
- Show how to make a deployment in the same pipeline but multi-environment. For example, first deploy the code in development and then in production.
- Optional: Explain and show which components could be used to deploy a web page or mobile app and perform a UX/UI test.
